# Notes

The testing framework will need to be completed before work can 
really begin on this library.  

Most the core tests will need to be refactored to use the mock objects 
that will be found in the test framework library.  

All tests that currently do not compile have been excluded till the tests
match their lucene 4.3 counter parts.  Some of these tests will need to 
be moved in order to match the reorganization of Lucene 4.x.
